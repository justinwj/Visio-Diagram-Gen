// Guide-post comment for DiagramBuilder.cs
// This file is part of the Visio Diagram Generator.
// TODO: Replace this guide-post with your implementation.
// Use clear, meaningful names for classes, methods, and variables.
// Encapsulate functionality and follow SOLID principles.
// Add XML documentation comments and unit tests to improve maintainability.
// Handle exceptions gracefully and log meaningful messages.
// Keep methods short and focused; avoid deep nesting and duplicated code.
// Use asynchronous programming for I/O-bound tasks when appropriate.
// See the provided standard and class modules for inspiration and reuse common patterns.
